# Aptabase Terms of Service

### 1. Introduction

Thank you for using Aptabase! We're happy you're here.

When we say ”company”, “we”, “our”, “us”, ”service” or ”services” in this document, we are referring to **Aptabase**, a service operated by **Sumbit Labs Limited**.

These Terms of Service (“Terms”, “Terms of Service”) govern your use of our web pages located at https://aptabase.com and https://us.aptabase.com. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using Aptabase.

Our Privacy Policy also governs your use of our Service and explains how we collect, safeguard and disclose information that results from your use of our web pages. Please read it here https://aptabase.com/legal/privacy.

Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy (“Agreements”). You acknowledge that you have read and understood Agreements, and agree to be bound of them.

If you do not agree with (or cannot comply with) Agreements, then you may not use the Service, but please let us know by emailing at support@aptabase.com so we can try to find a solution. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use Service.

Thank you for being responsible.

### 2. Communications

By creating an Account on our Service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or by emailing at.

### 3. Subscriptions

Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Sumbit Labs Limited cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Sumbit Labs Limited customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide Sumbit Labs Limited with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Sumbit Labs Limited to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

### 4. Free Trial

For our free trial, we explain the length of trial when you sign up. We do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for customers who pay for our services — we do not sell your data. After the trial period, you need to pay in advance to keep using the service. If you do not pay, we will freeze your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment. If your account has been frozen for 60 days, we may queue it up for auto-cancellation.

If you are upgrading from a free trial to a paid plan, we will charge you immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade.

### 5. Fee Changes

Sumbit Labs Limited, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

Sumbit Labs Limited will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

### 6. Refunds

Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.

### 7. No Use By Minors

Service is intended only for access and use by individuals at least eighteen (18) years old. By accessing or using any of Company, you warrant and represent that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age and with the full authority, right, and capacity to enter into this agreement and abide by all of the terms and conditions of Terms. If you are not at least eighteen (18) years old, you are prohibited from both the access and usage of Service.

### 8. Accounts

When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 18, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your account on Service.

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account. You agree to accept responsibility for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you, without appropriate authorization.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.

### 16. Changes

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
